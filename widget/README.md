This is the funnel widget.

Entry point is `/src/index.js`.

## Starting up

Install dependencies:

    npm install

Run this widget:

    npm start

This will start a web server on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Folder Structure

-   images - All images used to build the widget
-   components.js - Different sub components on the widget
-   helper.js : Helper functions
-   index.css
-   index.js - Entry file
-   index.spec.js - test file

## Incompleted Task

-   Draggable element on each of the steps to rearrange steps.This was not completed because I set priority level for
    this task to 1 and I could finish it within the speculated time.
-   UI bug , adjusting the close widget to overlay on the widget was taking longer than expected.
-   Adding typscript. It enables clean code. I already went a long with javascript before realizing the mistake I made.
-   Setting up jsdoc for commenting . I used the template instead
